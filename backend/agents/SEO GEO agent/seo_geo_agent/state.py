"""Persistence gate: Firestore in cloud mode, local JSON files when SEO_OFFLINE=1.

Doc ids use ``-`` separators only (``run-{brand}``, ``todos-{brand}``, ``brands``)
so the local fallback can map them 1:1 to Windows-safe filenames.

Three primitives: :func:`load` / :func:`save` / :func:`delete` for documents only
one writer ever touches, and :func:`mutate` for the ones two callers can write at
the same time. ``mutate`` lives here, next to the collection it transacts over,
because a second implementation of "read-modify-write, atomically" is how one of
the two ends up non-transactional; ``final_geo_agent.geo_store`` — which is where
this code was written, for the GEO spend counters — now forwards to it.
