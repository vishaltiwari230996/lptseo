"""Site brain — read the brand's own website, then advise like a consultant.

Pipeline: crawl (sitemap-first, capped) -> per-page summaries (LLM, cached by
content hash so re-runs only pay for changed pages) -> one expert pass over
the digest -> evidence-backed issues (become Fix-list items), auto-seeds for
the keyword lab, and a covered/missing topic map.

Honesty rule baked into the prompt and the schema: the model may quote the
site as evidence but may NOT invent traffic numbers — quantified estimates
only ever come from rank/volume data elsewhere in the agent.
